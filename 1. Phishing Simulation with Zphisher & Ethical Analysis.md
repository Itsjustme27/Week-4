## Disclaimer and Ethical Considerations

- Experiment conducted solely for educational purposes in a controlled lab environment
- No real user data was compromised

### Step 1: Installing zphisher

- To install zphisher, i found the github repository online, and cloned it into my `Desktop`, using the `git clone` command.

### Step 2: Creating a LinkedIn website disguised as the phishing website:

- As shown in the above screenshot, i selected the option `[14]` 

- **Output:**

- Since, I am simulating this on a lab setup, i will choose localhost for port forwarding as it is most ethical and safest option.

- **Output:**

- As you can see, I have successfully created a phishing website and hosted it on my local machine.


### Step 3: Simulating a phishing attack

- In this step i will deliberately open and put in **fake** credentials and check where those credentials go.

- **Output: (Accessing the website)**

- Now that we have accessed the website, I will try out entering the **fake** credentials like email : admin@gmail.com and password: admin@admin.

- **Output:**

- Let's check what it gets fishes us.

- **Output:**

![[screenshot_2025-02-02_14-18-29.png]]

- The output shows the captured credentials: admin@gmail.com | admin@admin, confirming a successful phishing simulation.

**KEY NOTE/Disclaimer**:
- The localhost setup ensures secure testing.


## Conclusion

- This phishing attack simulation was very educational and informative, this can be used to make people aware about the growing phishing attacks and make sure they won't get phished.
